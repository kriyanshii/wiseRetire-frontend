## 💡 Inspiration💡
- As all women in our team, we came to a discussion about how women need to understand finance better.
- We wanted to make our web app finfreedom since the right knowledge about managing finances for women can help them achieve financial independence, equal opportunities, retirement planning, and wealth accumulation which will enable women and other people be more confident about their investment choices, other than that they can achieve financial security, overcoming financial challenges and most importantly close the gender wealth gap.


## ⚙What does finfreedom do? ⚙️
- FinFreedom empowers homemakers to make better financial choices by bringing aspects of all the government schemes, low to now risk investment plans.
- Hence we've investment plans, government schemes and a retirement calculator all in one place.

## 🐝 How we built it 🐝
- We built it using ➖
  Auth0 Integration for Google authorisation.
  ReactjS for frontend development 
  APIs: we created them by ourselves to fetch all mutual funds and investment plans.

## 🚩 Challenges we ran into
- We faced integration with the CapitalOne API as it wasn't creating customers so ultimately we had to give up the idea of it and make it available to everyone.

## 🥇 Accomplishment(s) that we're proud of
- Our main achivement was to add support as API. 

## 📚 What we learned
- During our research for the app, we learned about women and there challenges around financial freedom.
- We learned more advanced concepts around APIs.
